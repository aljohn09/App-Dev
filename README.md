# Fun Fact!!
James Franco’s “stoner” character, Saul, was partially inspired by real-life cannabis culture.
While preparing for his role, Franco spent time with real-life marijuana dealers to get into character. One of his sources of inspiration was a guy who would always say, “You gotta have your own style,” which became a signature line for his character. Franco’s portrayal of Saul was also influenced by the fact that he was encouraged to act in a more improvisational way, allowing him to fully embrace the eccentricities of his character.

This authentic, off-the-cuff vibe helped make Saul one of the most memorable and quotable characters in the film!
